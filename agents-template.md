## Memory Workflow (GitMemo)

This project uses the gitmemo skill (`.mem` git repo) for AI long-term memory.

- **Before working**: search memories for relevant past solutions; reuse if applicable.
- **After completing a task**: write a memory if the task is repo-related and complete, and either produced a valuable outcome or the user explicitly asked to remember. If the user explicitly asked to remember, that overrides the "valuable outcome" requirement.
- **User unsatisfied**: delete the memory, redo, and rewrite.
